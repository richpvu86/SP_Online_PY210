# Introduction To Me:
#
# Hi, My name is Rich Powers and I am a student in the UW Python Programming 
# Class. I am currently working as an Enterprise Architect at DuPont in
# Wilmington, DE and I am planning on starting a graduate program in Data
# Science in January 2020 at University of Michigan. My objectives in the 
# class is to build my expertise in Python to prepare for the program. I 
# started in the IT field as a developer many years ago and I have done some
# work with Java and Object Oriented Programming a while back as well. While
# I have exposure to more modern programming languages, there are some 
# unique properties to Python that I an looking to understand more in depth 
# and I look forward to engage in the class.
